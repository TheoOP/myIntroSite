          London was the first european country I ever visited and what struck me the most was the hustle. In this aspect it 
          seemed very similar to New York and Boston. In terms of Cuisine there was one nice restaurant the Coppa Club with excellent atmosphere and good food,
          however I found none of the other restaurants to be very memorable. In terms of city cleanliness there was much to be desired as there was a lot of 
          trash often in the streets or sidewalks and there were rats especially in the train stations. However the memorable buildings like Buckingham Palace and 
          Big Ben were beautiful to see and aesthetically pleasing.          </p>

            My first reaction to Paris was that it truly was the city of love and that there were numerous couples.
            The cuisine was amazing, especially the pastries which were top tier.
            The attractions were numerous from the Eiffel Tower to the Louvre which housed so much history and amazing art, 
            not to mention the aesthetic value of those locations, as the pictures taken at those locations came out beautiful. 
            In terms of cleanliness there were some points to be gained as though there wasn't much trash ,
            there were strong smells in certain areas of the city.</p>

              Of the three cities though each had it's own history present Rome definitely struck me as a timeless city. The way the buildings were embedded into the ground 
              making use of old structures was amazing. The attractions there were amazing ranging from the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican to the Colosseum. The cuisine was good, 
              with the most striking being the gelato. The ancient aura worked to Rome's advantage and brought a unique aesthetic. 
              The cleanliness was not bad as well with nothing being to striking as I walked through the streets.
